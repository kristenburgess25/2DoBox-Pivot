# 2DoBox Pivot

Do you remember that project Ideabox?

We thought they were pretty great, but, I think it's time to pivot those projects over to something we like to call 2DoBox.

You will be inheriting someone's previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox. Your projects will utilize webpack & it's awesome development server. Keeping accessibility in mind we will be grading you based on how accessible your application is. Lastly you will implement feature tests using selenium webdriver.

# Getting Started ( Should I Fork or Clone?! )

Beginning The Pivot

Once you've explored the base project, the team leader will:

- Create a new, blank repository on GitHub named `2DoBox-Pivot`
- Clone the ideaBox project that you'll be working with to your local machine
- Go into that project directory and `git remote rm origin`
- Add the new repository as a remote `git remote add origin` `git://new_repo_url`
- Push the code  `git push origin master`
- Add the other team members as collaborators in Github
- Once the team leader has done this, the other team member can fork the new repo.

# Restrictions and Outside Code

Your project should evolve, refactor, and clean up the code you inherit. This includes deleting redundant, broken, or obsolete code. However, you should not throw out the previous work wholesale.

Furthermore, there should be no reduction in functionality except when explicitly called for by new requirements.

# Phase 1

### Adding a new ToDo

On the application‚Äôs main page, a user should:

* See two text boxes for entering the ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù and ‚ÄúTask‚Äù for a new TODO, and a ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button for committing that TODO.

* When a user clicks ‚ÄúSave‚Äù:
  * A new TODO with the provided title and body should appear in the TODO list.
  * The text fields should be cleared and ready to accept a new TODO.
  * The page should not reload.
  * The TODO should be persisted. It should still be present upon reloading the page


### Deleting an existing TODO

When viewing the TODO list:

  * Each TODO in the list should have a link or button to ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù (or ùó´).
  * Upon clicking ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù, the appropriate TODO should be removed from the list.
  * The page should not reload when an idea is deleted.
  * The TODO should be removed from localStorage. It should not re-appear on next page load.


### Editing an existing TODO

When a user clicks the title or task of a TODO in the list, that text should:

  * Become an editable text field, pre-populated with the existing  TODO title or task.
  * The user should be able to ‚Äúcommit‚Äù their changes by pressing ‚ÄúEnter/Return‚Äù or by clicking outside of the text field.
  * If the user reloads the page, their edits will be reflected.

### Searching

We‚Äôd like our users to be able to easily find specific TODOs they already created, so let‚Äôs provide them with a filtering interface on the TODO list.

  * At the top of the TODO list, include a text field labeled ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù.
  * As a user types in the search box, the list of TODOs should filter in real time to only display TODOs whose title or task include the user‚Äôs text.
  * The page should not reload.
  * Clearing the search box should restore all the ideas to the list.

# Phase 2

### Marking a TODO as completed

When viewing the TODO list:

  * Each TODO in the list should have a button called `Completed Task`
  * When a the user clicks the `Completed Task` button the idea should be either grayed out and/or shown with a strike through text
  * On reloading the page the page the completed TODOs should be exempted from the list.
  * When the user clicks the `show completed TODOs` The completed TODOs should be loaded back onto the top of the TODO list.

### Accessibility

Your web application should pass `aXe-core` tests and should be `tab index` accessible. For tab indexing refer to this [resource](http://archive.tlt.psu.edu/accessibility/tabindex0.html#whyzero)

### Importance

Each  TODO should be given a level of importance.

  * As a user I should be able to change the level of importance by up-voting or down-voting that specific  TODO.
  * Each  TODO should start with a level of `Normal`.
      * Levels of Importance are as follows

        1) Critical

        2) High

        3) Normal

        4) Low

        5) None

  * The change of importance should persist after a page refresh

# Phase 3

### Recent TODOs

The application should only show the ten most recent  TODOS.

  * The application should contain a button labeled ‚ÄúShow more TODOs ...‚Äù
  * When a user clicks on the `Show more TODOs...` button this list should load additional messages from the past.

### Filter by Importance

The application should allow users to filter the TODO list based off of importance.

* Your application should have 5 buttons corresponding to each level of importance (Critical, High, Normal, Low, and None).

* When one of the filter buttons is clicked the TODO list should only display TODOs with the selected importance.

### Character Counter

The application is able to count the number of characters inside of the input field in real time.

* As the user types the character count should increment up.
* If the user delets characters the character count should decrease.

### Submit button disabled

The submit button should be disabled when there is not valid content in both input fields and if the input field character count exceeds 120 characters.


# Extension

When viewing the TODO list:

  * Each TODO should have an option to set a due date for the specific TODO
  * Once a TODO's due date is reached the TODO should be marked as completed.

# Instructor Evaluation Points

## Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

1 - The application is missing 3 or more smaller features or 1 major feature essential to having a complete application.

0 - The application is unusable.

## Accessibility

4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to 'chunk' content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

3 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has 0-3 aXe-core violations.

2 - The application shows glimpses of good accessibility practices, but fails to deliver a truly accessible product. The application has 4-6 aXe-core violations

1- Developer did not keep accessibility in mind. The application has 6+ aXe-core violations.

## User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

2: Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear.
